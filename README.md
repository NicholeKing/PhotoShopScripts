# PhotoShopScripts
A library of scripts I've written to streamline my processes in PhotoShop, more to come
## Adding the Script to Your Photoshop
### Windows
Copy the .js or .jsx file you want to add to your Scripts.

Navigate to your Program Files folder on your computer and find the Photoshop folder.

Navigate into the Presets folder > go into the Scripts folder > paste the file in (you will need to give permission).

Start up Photoshop (or restart if you already had it open) and go to File > Scripts and you will see the new script there.

### Mac
Copy the .js or .jsx file you want to add to your Scripts.

Navigate to your Applications and open the Photoshop folder.

Go into the Defaults folder > enter the Scripts folder > paste the file in (you will need to give permission).

Start up Photoshop (or restart if you already had it open) and go to File > Scripts and you will see the new script there.

## Setting your script as a keyboard shortcut
Go to Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts.

In the window that will open, click File, scroll down until you see a sub-header for Scripts, you will see your script underneath, click on it and you will be able to set a new keyboard shortcut for it (just hit the buttons you want to use as a shortcut, Photoshop will tell you if it's already in use or not).

Apply your changes.

## Expand Fill
Expand fill prompts you for an amount you wish to expand a selection by and then fills that selection with the foreground color -- I often use this when coloring in the base of my lineart, and Photoshop doesn't have a hotkey for the expand tool so it used to be so tedious. 

*Requires that you have a selection made in order to work.*
