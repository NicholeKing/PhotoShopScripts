# PhotoShopScripts
A library of scripts I've written to streamline my processes in PhotoShop, more to come
## Expand Fill
Expand fill prompts you for an amount you wish to expand a selection by and then fills that selection with the foreground color -- I often use this when coloring in the base of my lineart, and PhotoShop doesn't have a hotkey for the expand tool so it used to be so tedious. *Requires that you have a selection made in order to work.
